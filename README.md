# Brain Puzzle
A simple puzzle game where a player uploads any image by drag/drop or select a image, which is then splitted into grids of specified rows and columns. After that they shuffle the grids and then can solve the puzzle. I have built it using HTMl,CSS/Bootstrap, JavaScript/Jquery. I would appreciate every contribution in making the project more elegant. Also, it would be a very valuable and important step in correcting any errors or bugs if they exist in it.<br/><br/>
